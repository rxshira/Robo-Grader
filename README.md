Make sure that you have all the files for the RoboGrader before running, including all the preloaded videos to the program.

As you run it, to begin a new project, click 'New Project' OR ‘Example Project’



NEW PROJECT:

Here, you can first type in the title for your project by clicking on the 'project title.' Make sure that it is containing only Letter and Numbers up to a max of 14 chars.

Next, upload a video of your robot moving. It must have a moving blue point and a stationary green point. 

Then, wait to select a temporary place on your computer to store the frames of the video. 

Wait until the green check mark in the circle shows up, and then you may proceed to the next step. 

Click on the 'Draw Path' button to draw the correct path for the robot.

Then, click on the green and red squares. Move them around to your desire in the canvas, and once you do that, click on the fix buttons under both of them.

After that, draw your path from the red 'start' box to the green 'end' box. Once you are done, click on the 'back' button. Click on the 'clear' button to erase all your drawings.

Then, click on the 'compare paths' button, and see your percent success! You can also click on the 'see image' button to see how your drawing compares with the actual path the robot took. 



EXAMPLE PROJECT:

Here, you can select from 5 video examples pre-loaded into the app. 

Click on ‘Select Video’, and then select one of the 5 options. 

Click on the 'Draw Path' button to draw the correct path for the robot.

Then, click on the green and red squares. Move them around to your desire in the canvas, and once you do that, click on the fix buttons under both of them.

After that, draw your path from the red 'start' box to the green 'end' box. Once you are done, click on the 'back' button. Click on the 'clear' button to erase all your drawings.

Then, click on the 'compare paths' button, and see your percent success! You can also click on the 'see image' button to see how your drawing compares with the actual path the robot took. 

*** A note on art: ***

All art in this project is my own. I drew it myself on IbisPaint on my iPad, and then uploaded it to Pinterest to get the image URL. 


*** A note on AI use: ***

I have used a mix of Microsoft Co-Pilot, ChatGPT, and Claude in this project. 
Of course, most of this code IS my own, and so is the idea and execution. 

However, I often asked AI to help me clean up my code. I did my best to make sure I credited it
where I used it, but I always have the lingering fear I may have missed some things. (I hope I didn't)

Sometimes I'd have it re-write functions to run cleaner or change the way I have my drawing functions appear, just to note some examples of my uses.

I mentioned when, where, and how I used the AI and what it helped me with. When used right, it is a very helpful tool, especially to 
get tedious UI work done fast!
